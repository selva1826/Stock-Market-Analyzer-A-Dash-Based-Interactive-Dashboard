# Stock Market Analysis Tool

This project is a real-time stock market analysis tool that allows users to visualize the performance of stocks using interactive candlestick charts. It enables investors, traders, and analysts to monitor stock data and gain deeper insights into stock price movements over time.

## Features:
- **Real-time Stock Data**: The tool integrates with the Yahoo Finance API (yFinance) to fetch the most up-to-date stock prices, volume, and other relevant market data.
- **Candlestick Charts**: Displays detailed candlestick charts to help users visualize opening, closing, high, and low prices for selected stocks. The charts are interactive, allowing users to explore different time frames and stock metrics.
- **User Input**: The tool provides an input field where users can enter the ticker symbol of the stock they want to analyze. This flexibility enables the analysis of any stock listed on major exchanges.
- **Customizable Timeframes**: Users can select different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly) to view stock performance over a specified period.
- **Responsive and Dynamic Layout**: The web-based interface is designed with Dash, offering a responsive layout and smooth user experience. The background design and components are tailored to provide a clean and visually engaging interface.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The core programming language used to build the tool.
- **Dash**: A powerful web framework for creating interactive web applications.
- **Plotly**: Used for creating dynamic, interactive candlestick charts.
- **yFinance**: A Python wrapper for Yahoo Finance, used to fetch real-time stock data.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library to structure and process stock data.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing and structuring the front-end layout.
